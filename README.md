# smo-paper
Contains Matlab code to run three numerical examples of a paper submitted to JSMO.

The example files are: ex1.m, ex2.m and ex3.m

These Matlab scripts call CPAS, PENLAB, and FMINSDP to solve an optimization problem.

CPLEX must be installed to run CPAS.

PENLAB can be obtained from: https://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/kocvara/penlab/

and FMINSDP from: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43643-fminsdp
